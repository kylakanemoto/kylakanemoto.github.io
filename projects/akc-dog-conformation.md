Although I explored a many hobbies growing up, none truly resonated with me. From art classes to summer workshops, these experiences were fun and engaging, but they never felt like activities that I could commit to in the long run. My introduction to American Kennel Club (AKC) dog conformation–or AKC dog shows, for short, where dogs are judged on how closely they meet their breed standards–came through my mom, who had been showing Pembroke Welsh Corgis since highschool. Initially, my fear of dogs kept me from developing an interest. However, after getting my Brittany, whose calm and gentle demeanor helped me overcome my fears, I decided to give dog conformation a go.

I participated in my first dog show in middle school and have loved the sport ever since. In the beginning, I was overwhelmed by the routine of training every Saturday as well as during the week. I hadn’t expected dog conformation to require so much patience, focus, and commitment. There were moments of frustration, especially on days when the dog I was training and I weren’t in sync, but I persevered and adapted. Over time, I developed the skills to confidently train and handle dogs for shows, working with different breeds and temperaments from Pembroke Welsh Corgis to Miniature American Shepherds. Furthermore, I grew an appreciation for the dog show community and enjoyed learning more about the care, history, and purpose of various breeds.

Dog conformation has helped me grow as an individual. It strengthened my communication skills, as most participants are older and I needed to express myself clearly and confidently. The sport also taught me flexibility and patience, especially when I had to sacrifice my own time for training, or work with dogs with unique personalities. Additionally, I became more adaptable and eager to learn techniques and tips shared by more experienced handlers. Overall, dog conformation has not only been a rewarding hobby but also a valuable teacher, helping me develop perseverance, empathy, and effective communication.

Today, I still participate in dog conformation and have made a name for myself within the community. While winning and collecting ribbons is enjoyable, what I value most are the bonds I build with the dogs and the friendships I develop with people of all ages and backgrounds.
