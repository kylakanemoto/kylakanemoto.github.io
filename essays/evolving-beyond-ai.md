As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly sophisticated in the technical world, I have grown concerned about its impact on the future of software engineering. Many entry-level jobs are already being automated, as companies are now seeking candidates with senior-level experience. Articles about unemployment and layoffs of software engineers were discouraging and thus made me question the value of a computer science degree. However, I am remaining hopeful that software engineers will continue to be needed for skills that artificial intelligence still has not perfected, such as creativity, problem-solving, and ethical reasoning.
  
## Beyond the code
  
Before taking ICS 314, I used to view software engineering as primarily writing code for programming projects. However, after just two weeks into the course, I have learned that it extends far beyond basic coding and into the architecture, development, and maintenance of software systems. As a result, I have become more interested in software engineering, specifically in the design and implementation of software. I am curious about how software engineers build systems from scratch and determine which solutions are most efficient and meaningful to their goals. Additionally, I am intrigued by the role of artificial intelligence in software engineering and how it improves productivity by handling redundant tasks such as writing boilerplate code.
  
## Future me 
  
Looking ahead, I hope to strengthen both my understanding and performance in software engineering and artificial intelligence. I want to experience approaching problems with the mindset of a software engineer and writing code with greater intention. Furthermore, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of algorithms and problem-solving strategies, which will help prepare me for technical interviews. Ultimately, I will strive to become a well-rounded software engineer with the knowledge and experience companies value. Although the software industry faces many challenges, I am determined to overcome them with curiosity and an eagerness to learn, growing alongside this ever-evolving field.
