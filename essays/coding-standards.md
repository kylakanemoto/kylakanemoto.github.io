Throughout my computer science journey, I have never been great at sticking to coding standards. I would begin my programs with the correct indentation and spacing, but as I got into coding, I would forget about creating a separate line from functions or adding spaces before brackets. As a result, my code ended up semi-formatted, and sometimes it was difficult to differentiate my lines of code. Then, I had to go back and clean up my messy code, which was often frustrating and time-consuming. 

## Red All Over
Now that I have spent a week using ESLint in VSCode, I am beginning to get the hang of coding standards. At first, ESLint was overwhelming–red lines all over my screen flagging things that I thought were insignificant.  Error messages like “missing space before opening brace” or “trailing spaces not allowed” seemed trivial to me. The program ran without issues, and I could not understand why ESLint was underlining them like they were major errors. This part of ESLint felt a little nitpicky and unnecessary.

## Consistent, Readable, Collaboration
However, I soon realized that these error messages were not just for aesthetic purposes; it was teaching me consistency and organization. Instead of reformatting my program at the end, I learned to format my code throughout, from beginning to end. This made my programs easier to read, and less confusing as I was able to understand what each block of code meant. In addition, keeping a consistent program structure allowed me to be more productive in solving the problem as it had better readability and flow. 

Futhermore, I realized following a coding standard is important for others who may analyze my code in the future. Before, I created programs solely for myself, but now that I am beginning to collaborate with others on programs, I understand that my code also needs to be clear enough to communicate my intentions. ESLint emphasizes writing understandable and efficient code, which are two characteristics that lead to smoother collaboration.

## Conclusion
Overall, my first week using ESLint was both challenging and rewarding. I struggled with breaking my habit of not being consistent with my formatting, but soon adapted the skill. It has made me a better programmer as I am able to better understand how my code works and communicate my ideas. Although I still cringe whenever I see those red squiggly lines, I view them as reminders of improving my coding ethic and getting to a point where coding standards come automatically to me.
